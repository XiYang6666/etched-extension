# Etched-Extension

[简体中文](/README.md) | English

Adds support for [Meting-api](https://github.com/injahow/meting-api) and NetEase Cloud Music share links to [Etched](https://github.com/jacksonhardaway/etched).

NetEase Cloud Music tracks are resolved using the [ebnr API](https://github.com/XiYang6666/EvenBetterNeteaseResolver).

You can change the ebnr API endpoint in the configuration. The default endpoint does not support VIP tracks; when using a non-VIP API, the track can be etched successfully, but playback will result in an error.
